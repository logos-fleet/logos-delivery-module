# RLN bridge

The delivery library (liblogosdelivery) does not implement RLN itself — it
asks an external RLN module for every RLN operation. Its plugin is
implementation-agnostic: it never names a registry or a membership, carries
no configuration and never starts the backend. All of that lives here. This
module answers those requests in-process: `src/rln_bridge.cpp` adds the
registry id and rln identifier from `configureRln`, calls the co-loaded
`liblogos_rln_module` and feeds each reply back unchanged. Every request is
also emitted as an `rln*Request` event for observability; `rlnRespond`
exists to answer a request from outside, but on a bridge-enabled node the
bridge answers first and a second response per reqId is rejected.

Replies cross verbatim — the wire schema is owned by the RLN module and the
delivery library, not modelled here. The only replies the bridge fabricates
are transport failures. If nothing answers a request at all, the library
times it out itself and everything non-RLN keeps working.

## Configuring a node for RLN testing

RLN has its own module method, `configureRln`, called before `createNode`.
It never rides the node config: `createNode` is a pass-through to the
library, which knows nothing about RLN beyond an installed plugin.

```json
{
  "registry-id": "logos:testnet:0",
  "rln-identifier": "<exactly 64 hex chars — validated as 32 bytes>",
  "epoch-size-sec": 120
}
```

- Installing the plugin is what makes the library mount RLN over it, and it
  reads that at node creation — hence the ordering. Without the call the
  node comes up with RLN off.
- This module starts `liblogos_rln_module` itself; the library no longer
  does. A start failure fails `configureRln`. A bridge that cannot come up
  is not fatal: the `rln*Request` events plus `rlnRespond` remain, but
  nothing starts the backend on that path.
- `liblogos_rln_module` is declared in `metadata.json#dependencies`, so the
  host auto-loads it along with its own deps (`liblogos_lez_rln_module`,
  `lez_core`).
- Bring-up fires `start` from this module, then the library's
  `get_membership_state` gate: the node's membership must already be
  `active` or `grace_period` — registration happens out-of-band, through the
  RLN module, not through this library or its plugin.
  Without one (e.g. no chain), `start` fails with the RLN module's own
  error carried verbatim into `nodeStarted`.

## Running the e2e

`tests/e2e/run.sh` boots a logosctl daemon over the four module bundles and
asserts the bring-up chain; its header documents the env knobs. The daemon
log — `<run dir>/session/logs/daemon.log` — carries the library's log lines.

## Time budgets

The library gives each request a budget before synthesizing a TRANSIENT
failure itself: 80 s for the registry reads (`get_membership_state`,
`generate_proof`), 10 s for the rest. The bridge's raw-call timeout for a
read (70 s) sits just under that; the remaining ops go through the generated
typed client, whose reply arrives well inside the 10 s budget. The
module-driven `start` and `stop` have no library clock behind them and
borrow the 80 s read budget.
