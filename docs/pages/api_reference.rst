API reference
=============

Everything ``delivery_module`` exposes, generated from the doc comments in
``src/delivery_module_plugin.h``: the methods you call, and the events they
report back through.

Events
------

A caller never invokes these. Every method above returns as soon as its request
is dispatched, and what actually happened on the network arrives here — so
subscribe to these rather than reading a return value.

``send`` and ``channelSend`` return a request id, and every event reporting the
outcome of that call carries the same id, so several messages can be in flight
at once.

Timestamps are ``int64`` nanoseconds since the Unix epoch. ``messageReceived``
reports the timestamp carried by the message itself; every other event is
stamped by the module host when the event is emitted.
